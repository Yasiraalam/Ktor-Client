# Project Title (e.g., Ktor Android Sample App)

A brief one-sentence description of what your project does.

## Overview

This Android application demonstrates how to use Ktor for making network requests and Kotlinx Serialization for parsing JSON responses in a Jetpack Compose-based UI.

*(Expand here: What is the main purpose of this app? What problem does it solve or what does it showcase? What are the key features?)*

## Features

*   Fetches data from a remote API using Ktor.
*   Parses JSON responses using Kotlinx Serialization.
*   Displays data in a Jetpack Compose UI.
*   (Add more features specific to your app, e.g., "User authentication," "Displays a list of items," "Allows users to post data," etc.)

## Technologies Used

*   **Kotlin:** Primary programming language.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** For building the native Android UI.
*   **Ktor Client:** For making HTTP requests.
    *   `ktor-client-android`: Android-specific engine.
    *   `ktor-client-content-negotiation`: For handling request/response content types.
    *   `ktor-serialization-kotlinx-json`: For JSON serialization/deserialization with Kotlinx Serialization.
    *   `ktor-client-logging`: For logging network request details.
*   **Kotlinx Serialization:** For efficient JSON parsing.
*   **Android Jetpack:**
    *   `ViewModel`: (If you are using it for state management)
    *   `Lifecycle`: For lifecycle-aware components.
    *   (Add other Jetpack libraries you're using)
*   **Gradle Kotlin DSL:** For build configuration.
